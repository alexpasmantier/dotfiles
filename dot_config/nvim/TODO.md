## IN PROGRESS

## TODO

### top priorities
- search highlights

### other stuff
- flash.nvim looks nice, investigate
- check out Harpoon
- check out (and use?) telescope file browser
- create PR for dogrun in lualine
- try out mini.files, and the mini start screen (I forget the name)
- try out [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround)
- more config for Octo?
- [pytest user command](https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager/blob/master/xdg_config/nvim/after/ftplugin/python.vim) (this might involve recreating the Pytest command he uses)
- neorg + whichkey

## MIGHT BE NICE
- can [asyncrun](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim) be useful in any way?
- add trouble.nvim ?
- configure neovide as a default desktop editor for opening various filetypes
- nvim startup screen disappears because of lualine
